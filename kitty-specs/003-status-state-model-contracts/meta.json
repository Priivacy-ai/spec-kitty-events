  "source_description": "Implement the events-library side of the remediation defined in prd-feature-status-state-model-remediation.md. Make this library the shared contract authority for feature/WP status events used by CLI and SaaS. Add typed event/payload contracts for status transitions and evidence-bearing completion. Add schemas/models covering lane transitions, force metadata, execution mode, review rollback reference, and done evidence. Add a pure reference reducer and deterministic ordering/reduction support primitives. Add validation helpers for transition legality and payload integrity. Version as 0.3.0-alpha.",
